Your palm, as viewed through the unseen geometry of time, reflects
the bridge between destiny and choice. The ridges flow like rivers of memory —
each crossing, each curve, a footprint of divine consciousness seeking form.
In the ${hand} hand, the pulse of energy radiates through the sacred lines,
forming signatures of soul journeys once walked and yet to come.

The Heart Line sings of emotion as a vessel of compassion;
the Head Line breathes thought into vision and manifestation;
the Life Line whispers endurance, health, and karmic rhythm.
When combined, they form the triad of existence — Love, Mind, and Life.

Moments of light appear where breaks exist — not as flaws, but awakenings.
Your being carries remembrance beyond this incarnation,
and each mark is a testament to lessons transformed into grace.
May you move with awareness, strength, and devotion.
