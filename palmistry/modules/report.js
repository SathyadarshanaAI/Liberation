<h3>ðŸª¶ ${hand} Hand Summary Reading</h3>
<p>
Dear ${name}, your ${hand.toLowerCase()} hand reveals a quiet depth and balance between 
mind and spirit. The <b>Life Line</b> curves evenly around the thumb, showing endurance, 
physical vitality, and a life shaped by reflection rather than rush. 
Your <b>Head Line</b> runs clear toward the Mount of Moon â€” this marks imagination, 
a love of inner discovery, and the gift of philosophical thought. 
The <b>Heart Line</b> is gently curved, suggesting compassion that grows from silence, 
and the ability to forgive deeply. The <b>Fate Line</b> appears subtle yet resilient, 
showing that destiny in your case is not forced by others, but cultivated by your 
own will and spiritual discipline. Together, these lines form the signature of a 
soul walking the middle path â€” one who transforms solitude into wisdom, 
and challenge into inner peace. 
May your insight continue to deepen with grace as the hand of time unfolds.

<h2>ðŸŒ• ${hand} Hand â€“ Comprehensive Palmistry Analysis</h2>
<p>
This extended analysis is generated through the Sathyadarshana Quantum Palm Analyzer V5.8. 
It integrates traditional Hastashastra, modern Krishnamurti palm parameters, and AI pattern 
recognition derived from density, curvature, and micro-feature mapping of ${hand.toLowerCase()} hand imagery.
</p>

<h3>1. Life Line</h3>
<p>
The Life Line begins near the Mount of Jupiter, flowing in a balanced arc around the base of the thumb. 
It symbolizes endurance, the capacity to recover from adversity, and a karmic rhythm of gradual 
strengthening through trials. Fine islands indicate moments of fatigue or mental strain, 
yet the absence of sharp breaks shows a mind that heals naturally. 
A secondary branch toward the Venus mount marks spiritual rejuvenation through compassion and faith. 
</p>

<h3>2. Head Line</h3>
<p>
The Head Line demonstrates philosophical insight and independence of thought. 
Its smooth curvature toward the Moon Mount indicates imagination and intuitive intelligence. 
Cross markings at intersections suggest a period of conflict between reason and faith, 
ultimately harmonized through study or meditation. 
When the line slightly dips downward, it points to visionary thinkingâ€”artists, writers, or seekers 
who find revelation through silence.
</p>

<h3>3. Heart Line</h3>
<p>
Emotionally refined, your Heart Line shows loyalty, empathy, and resilience. 
It begins below the index finger, implying idealistic love, 
and extends evenly across the palm, revealing equilibrium between giving and receiving affection. 
Faint parallel lines beneath indicate hidden wounds transformed into compassion. 
The absence of abrupt endings symbolizes emotional maturityâ€”love without bondage, care without attachment.
</p>

<h3>4. Fate Line</h3>
<p>
The Fate Line rises from the base of the palm, intersecting the Life Line before advancing to the Saturn Mount. 
This intersection denotes early responsibilities in life shaping a later sense of purpose. 
Although light in tone, its persistence shows self-determined destiny. 
An upward branch signals spiritual service or intellectual vocation rather than material ambition. 
Periods of fading correspond to introspective retreats rather than failures.
</p>

<h3>5. Sun Line</h3>
<p>
The Sun Line appears moderate but continuous, suggesting gradual recognition of your inner gifts. 
Your creativity is not external showmanship but luminous sincerity. 
A secondary line approaching from the Life Line indicates divine inspiration manifesting 
after periods of solitude. Public respect follows private integrity.
</p>

<h3>6. Health (Mercury) Line</h3>
<p>
The Mercury line shows subtle fluctuationsâ€”linked to nervous sensitivity more than physical weakness. 
Stress patterns around this line reveal empathy overload; meditation, rhythmic breathing, 
and artistic expression will restore harmony. 
Absence of dark intersections suggests natural healing energy and disciplined routine.
</p>

<h3>7. Marriage Line</h3>
<p>
The relationship lines beneath the little finger reveal profound emotional awareness. 
One distinct line with clarity and upward inclination shows a single, enduring connection, 
rooted in shared ideals rather than convenience. 
Faint secondary marks hint at karmic encounters or souls met for spiritual evolution.
</p>

<h3>8. Bracelet (Manikanda) Lines</h3>
<p>
Three well-defined bracelets represent harmony between body, mind, and spirit. 
Each ring reflects a layer of karmic protection. 
The first denotes physical balance, the second emotional stability, 
and the third marks spiritual inheritance â€” connection to wisdom across lifetimes.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
The collective geometry of your ${hand.toLowerCase()} hand reveals a seeker guided by intuition and endurance. 
While worldly challenges test patience, the underlying matrix of your lines displays stability 
rooted in virtue and awareness. The more you walk in truth and simplicity, 
the stronger these patterns resonate. The analyzer detects elevated luminescence 
along zones linked to compassion and insightâ€”confirming that your evolution 
follows the path of inner illumination rather than mere fortune.
